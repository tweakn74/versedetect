Analysts receive a concise view of the forward target plus the intel context that justifies response.\n","tuning":"- Maintain up-to-date freemail/disposable lists; update weekly to catch new throwaway providers.   - Add a lookup of approved forwarding domains (`approved_forward_domains`) to automatically suppress business-justified\n  destinations.  \n- If you collect Defender alerts, combine them with this search in RBA to collapse duplicate events into one notable.\n","related":["impossible-travel-alert-risk-fusion","impossible-travel-adjacent-pair"],"updated":"2025-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","content":"## Dual-source coverage\n\nThis detector doubles as a triage surface for Defender’s “Suspicious inbox forwarding rule” alert and as a direct signal\nfrom the Unified Audit Log. Even if Defender misses the forwarding rule, the Exchange telemetry still raises the flag\nwith the same enrichment and risk scoring.\n\n## Quick response guidance\n\n- Confirm whether the destination domain is business-approved. Disposable domains and newly registered domains are\n  high-fidelity indicators of compromise.  \n- Disable the forwarding rule and force a password reset for the impacted account.  \n- Hunt for additional inbox rules across the tenant using the `rule_display` values output by the search."}]},{"tacticId":"TA0009","tacticName":"Collection","techniqueId":"T1056","techniqueName":"Input
