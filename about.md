Versedetect is Craig Glatt’s working notebook for detection & response engineering. It blends production-ready Splunk
queries with the enrichment logic, false-positive tuning notes, and operational context usually lost in slide decks.

## Why this exists

- **Quality over volume.** The goal is a curated library of detections that security engineers can trust without weeks
  of rework.
- **Explainability.** Each detection includes the “why” alongside the “what” — enrichments, decision thresholds, and
  operator tips are first-class content.
- **Coverage transparency.** MITRE ATT&CK views make it obvious where the program is strong today and where the roadmap
  points next.
